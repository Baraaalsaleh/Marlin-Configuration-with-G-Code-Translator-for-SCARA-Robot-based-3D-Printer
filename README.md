The aim of this project is to create a full solution for the reverse engineering process, from creating a 3D-Model of a real object using a simple camera to the manufacturing of that object using a SCARA-Robot based 3D-Printer (which is part of the project too).

This repository include the desktop-application developed for reconstructing the 3D-model from images with multiple usefull image processing support. The actual creation of a mesh object using images is done by Alice-Vision which has to be added to the folder of the project in order for photogrametry to work properly.
The application can easily be integrated with firebase, you only need to add serviceAccountKey.json to the project folder.
